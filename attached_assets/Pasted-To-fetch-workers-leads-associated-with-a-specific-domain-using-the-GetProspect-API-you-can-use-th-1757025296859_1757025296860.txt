To fetch workers (leads) associated with a specific domain using the GetProspect API, you can use the **Search leads** endpoint. This endpoint allows you to search for leads based on filters, including the company domain. Below, I’ll guide you through the process using the provided API key and the GetProspect API documentation.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Search Leads Endpoint**
   - The **Search leads** endpoint is used to retrieve leads based on specific filters, such as the company domain.
   - According to the GetProspect API documentation, this endpoint supports querying leads from their B2B contact database, which includes data sourced from LinkedIn and other searches.[](https://getprospect.com/help-center/data-enrichment-and-email-search/how-to-make-a-search-for-leads-or-companies-using-getprospect-database)
   - The relevant endpoint is likely under the `contacts` or `lists` section, as these handle lead-related queries.[](https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/getprospect/documentation/0rxxk4c/getprospect-api)

2. **API Endpoint**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.getprospect.com/public/v1/leads`
   - This endpoint allows you to search for leads using query parameters like `domain` to filter by a specific company domain.

3. **Authentication**
   - You need to include your API key in the request header for authentication.
   - **Header**: `Authorization: Bearer 95ecc6ae-314d-42a8-aa54-b61207a13883`

4. **Request Parameters**
   - To fetch workers from a specific domain, use the `domain` query parameter.
   - Example: To search for leads from the domain `example.com`, you would include `domain=example.com` in the query.
   - Additional optional parameters (if needed):
     - `job_title`: Filter by specific job titles (e.g., "Developer", "Manager").
     - `location`: Filter by geographical location.
     - `page` and `per_page`: For pagination, to control the number of results returned.

5. **Example cURL Request**
   Here’s how you can construct a cURL request to fetch leads for a specific domain:

   ```bash
   curl --location 'https://api.getprospect.com/public/v1/leads?domain=example.com' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer 95ecc6ae-314d-42a8-aa54-b61207a13883'
   ```

   - Replace `example.com` with the actual domain you want to search for (e.g., `acme.com`).
   - This request will return leads associated with the specified domain, including details like names, emails (if available), and job titles.

6. **Response Format**
   - The response will be in JSON format and typically includes:
     - A list of leads with details like `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `job_title`, `company_name`, etc.
     - Pagination information (e.g., `total`, `page`, `per_page`).
   - Example response:

     ```json
     {
       "data": [
         {
           "id": "lead_id_123",
           "first_name": "John",
           "last_name": "Doe",
           "email": "john.doe@example.com",
           "job_title": "Software Engineer",
           "company_name": "Example Inc.",
           "domain": "example.com"
         },
         ...
       ],
       "meta": {
         "total": 50,
         "page": 1,
         "per_page": 10
       }
     }
     ```

7. **Optional: Refine the Search**
   - If you want to narrow down the results (e.g., by job title or location), add more query parameters. For example:
     ```bash
     curl --location 'https://api.getprospect.com/public/v1/leads?domain=example.com&job_title=Engineer' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer 95ecc6ae-314d-42a8-aa54-b61207a13883'
     ```
   - Check the API documentation for all available filters.[](https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/getprospect/documentation/0rxxk4c/getprospect-api)

8. **Handling Bulk Domains**
   - If you need to search for multiple domains at once, GetProspect supports bulk domain searches through the platform’s UI (up to 500 domains per search or 50,000 via file import). However, the API typically processes one domain at a time in the `leads` endpoint. For bulk searches, you may need to iterate over multiple API calls or check if a specific bulk endpoint exists.[](https://getprospect.com/help-center/data-enrichment-and-email-search/bulk-domain-search)

9. **Error Handling**
   - Common errors:
     - **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing API key. Ensure the `Authorization` header is correct.
     - **400 Bad Request**: Invalid query parameters. Double-check the `domain` format.
     - **429 Too Many Requests**: You’ve hit the rate limit. Check your plan’s limits or wait before retrying.
   - The API documentation provides details on error codes and rate limits.[](https://apitracker.io/a/getprospect)

10. **Additional Notes**
    - The GetProspect API is RESTful and returns JSON responses, making it easy to integrate with your application.[](https://www.apirefs.com/apps/getprospect)
    - If no leads are returned for a domain, it may not exist in GetProspect’s B2B database, or additional filters (e.g., job title) may be too restrictive.
    - For further details, refer to the official GetProspect API documentation at https://getprospect.readme.io/. You can also explore the Postman collection for pre-built requests.[](https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/getprospect/documentation/0rxxk4c/getprospect-api)[](https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/getprospect/collection/0rxxk4c/getprospect-api)

### Example in JavaScript (Using Fetch API)
If you’re integrating this into a JavaScript application, here’s an example using the Fetch API:

```javascript
const fetchLeads = async (domain) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.getprospect.com/public/v1/leads?domain=${domain}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer 95ecc6ae-314d-42a8-aa54-b61207a13883'
    }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
};

fetchLeads('example.com');
```

### Limitations
- The GetProspect API may not return all workers for a domain if the data isn’t available in their database. The database relies on historical searches and LinkedIn data, so coverage may vary.[](https://getprospect.com/help-center/data-enrichment-and-email-search/how-to-make-a-search-for-leads-or-companies-using-getprospect-database)
- Check your API plan’s rate limits and quotas, as these may restrict the number of requests you can make. For pricing or quota details, visit https://x.ai/grok.[](https://martech.zone/getprospect-find-b2b-email-addresses-and-manage-prospects/)
